Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Oct 2020

# The research setting
- No international competition between two countries during the war
- [chess.com](https://chess.com) operates 24/7! (the biggest online chess platform)
  - About 30,000 games happen every hour worldwide
- Scraped all games played between Armenian and Azerbaijani chess.com users in 2020. 
  - ~8,000 games with 2,200 during conflict

$\\[.15cm]$

**Research question:**
- Do people (chess players) reflect international conflict on their behavior?
  - Do they play more aggressively?
  - Does the impact depend on who initiated the war/winning side?

# Chess data: Board Complexity

- Estimate probability of making a mistake on a given position
  - Most positions are unique, so can't look at historical data
  - **Solution:** Machine learning (neural network) that learns the types positions where mistakes happen the most

```{r,echo=F, out.width="70%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("image3.png")
```
$\\[.1cm]$
- Trained on a sample with 25,000 games played in tournaments, ~2 million moves
- Used to estimate complexity of games in the Armenia-Azerbaijan sample
