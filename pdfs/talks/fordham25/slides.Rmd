**Research question:**
- Is nationalism "a thing" in online platforms? 

--
  - Do participants response to international conflicts? <br> Behavioral responses, aggressiveness..
  
--
- Potentially problematic for the platform. (Organizer's POV)
  
--

<br>

- Broader: Do *residents* of countries get more hostile towards each other during a war?

--

<blockquote>Or, is war "just politics"?</blockquote>



---
# Obervational data?
- An RCT to answer this research question is infeasible.
- Data from individuals' interactions, while their countries are at war against each other?

--
... sports?

--
- No international contest between two countries during a war
  - E.g., Russian soccer team was banned from competing in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
  
--
<br>
- Online platforms?

--
- [chess.com](https://chess.com) operates 24/7! (the biggest online chess platform)
  - ~30,000 games happen each hour worldwide

# Conflicts

Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) Dyadic Dataset version 23.1

- Two "countries"
- "Substantial" military involvement (>1,000 number of soldiers actively engaged)
    - Excluding (for now) small "border clashes", e.g., between India and Pakistan, China...
- Since 2010 (that's when chess.com's data becomes available)
  - Excluding (for now) the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflict

# Conflicts

Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Oct-Nov 2020

~5,000-10,000 casualties (mostly military)

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=4, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(43.1, 41.5, zoom = 5)
```

# Conflicts

Conflict between Ukraine and Russia, Feb 2022-cont.

\>500,000 casualties (military and civilian)

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=4, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(33.1, 51.5, zoom = 4)
```


---
# How to proceed?
- We web-scraped games played by Armenian, Azerbaijani, Ukrainian, and Russian players before and after the start of conflict

  - Arm-Az: ~261,000 games with 20,000 during conflict
  - Ukr-Ru: ~520,000 games with 120,000 during conflict
  
- More refined research question: Do people (chess players) reflect international conflict on their behavior?
- Outcomes we look at
  - How does each player perform? I.e., accuracy
  - Do they play more aggressively?
  - Mechanisms? Does the impact depend on who initiated the war, army size, public support?

# A simple model

$$U_{y, i, j}  = \alpha_y+\beta_{y, j} \quad y\in\{win, draw, loss\}$$

where $U_{y, i, j}$ is the utility player $i$ obtains from outcome $y$ against opponent $j$. Assume 

$$\begin{align}\label{eq:2}
    y =\begin{cases}
     win & \text{with probability } p(a) \\
     loss & \text{with probability } q(a) \\
     draw & \text{with probability } 1-p(a)-q(a)
    \end{cases}
\end{align}$$

$$\small\begin{align}\label{eq:5}
    &\max_{a} \mathbb{E}[U_{y, i, j}] \\
    &\max_{a} p(a)\big(\alpha_{win}+\beta_{win, j}\big) +\big(1-p(a)-q(a)\big)\big(\alpha_{draw}+\beta_{draw, j}\big)+q(a)\big(\alpha_{loss}+\beta_{loss, j}\big)  \nonumber
\end{align}$$

$\Rightarrow$ Aggression: More pleasure from beating a hostile opponent raises aggression, but an isolated increase in disutility from losing against a hostile opponent lowers aggression. (ambiguous net effect)

$\Rightarrow$ Performance: Improves with effort, but declines with mental pressure/stress with playing against an opponent from hostile nation. (ambiguous net effect)

# Chess data: Risk & Board Complexity
- Aggressiveness/"risk level" of a chess game? 
  - Gerdes and Gransmark (2010, Labour Econ); Dreber et. al. (2013, JEBO): opening strategy
  - Bilen and Matros (2023, JEBO): neural-network
- Estimate probability of making a mistake on a given position
  - Most positions are unique, so can't look at historical data
  - **Solution:** Machine learning, e.g., a neural network that learns the "types" of positions and where mistakes happen the most
  - Trained on a separate sample with 25,000 games played in OTB tournaments, ~2 million moves
  - Use the model to estimate the complexity of games in the conflict sample

# Empirical Strategy

- "Differences in Differences"
  - E.g., Ukrainian vs. Russian players before and after the conflict.
  - Their games against other non-conflict countries before and after the conflict
- No variation in treatment timing: post same for everyone.
- How do users get matched? Random. BUT, can someone "refuse" to play? Yes. Sample is biased towards zero.


$Y_{ijg}=\gamma H_{ijg}+\pmb{X_{ijg}}'\pmb{\beta}+T_g+\alpha_i+u_{ijg}$

where $H_{ijg}$ equals 1 if a game $g$ between player $i$ and player $j$ happened between players of "treated" countries post the conflict starting date. $T_g$ is yearmonth FEs; $\alpha_i$ is player FEs. $u_{ijg}$ is the idiosyncratic shock.

$Y_{ijg}$ includes performance e.g., mistakes, blunders; game outcomes e.g., win, loss; and the choice of game complexity as proxy for aggression.
  - Secondary outcomes: "How the game ended": e.g., "agree" to a draw, "stalling" a game; game length (measured by total number of moves).

# Takeaways

- Conflicts impacted the moves made by chess players
  - Evidence for aggressive moves played by lower ranked players.
- Higher effort
  - More resiliency: longer games with less resigning and more mates.
  - Quality improvements come from the highest rating quartile.
- Risk aversion
  - Games end up more as draws.
- About uniform response from both sides.
- Player retention structural model to come.
