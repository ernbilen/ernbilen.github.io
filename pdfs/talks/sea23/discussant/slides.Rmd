# Comments
- My personal story with interactive graphing
- Biggest challenge: interface
 - I love it (and I'm very picky)
 - Should be in steps? ''Next page/Next exercise button'' bottom right.
 - Potential to gamify?: i.e. https://ncase.me/trust/
 - A second idea: Students come up with questions - other students solve

# Comments cont.
- Field experiment (but still can compare cohorts) 
  - e.g., majoring in econ?
  - Performance? Gains should be biggest in graphing questions
- Citations from math lit. i.e., calculus?
