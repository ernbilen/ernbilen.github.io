**Research question:**
- Is nationalism "a thing" in online platforms? 

--
  - Do participants response to international conflicts? <br> Behavioral responses, aggressiveness..
  
--
- Potentially problematic for the platform. (Organizer's POV)
  
--

<br>

- Broader: Do *residents* of countries get more hostile towards each other during a war?

--

<blockquote>Or, is war "just politics"?</blockquote>

---

# Research setting
- Data can come from experiments (gold standard!) or observations.
- How would an experiment involving international conflict look like?

--
- Take $n$ perfectly peaceful countries. Randomly pair them up. Flip a coin for each: if H let them declare war on each other, if T no war.

---
# Obervational data?
- Data from individuals' interactions, while their countries are at war against each other

--
... sports?

--
- No international contest between two countries during a war
  - E.g., Russian soccer team was banned from competing in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
  
--
<br>
- Online platforms?

--
- [chess.com](https://chess.com) operates 24/7! (the biggest online chess platform)
  - ~30,000 games happen each hour worldwide
  - Maybe some are during conflict?

# Conflicts

Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) Dyadic Dataset version 23.1

- Two "countries"
- "Substantial" military involvement (X number of soldiers actively engaged)
- Since 2010 (that's when chess.com started)

# Conflicts

Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Oct-Nov 2020

~5,000-10,000 casualties (mostly military)

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=4, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(43.1, 41.5, zoom = 5)

# Conflicts

Conflict between Ukraine and Russia, Feb 2022-cont.

\>100,000 casualties (military and civilian)

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=4, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(33.1, 51.5, zoom = 4)

# How to proceed?
- We web-scraped games played by Armenian, Azerbaijani, Ukrainian, and Russian players before and after the start of conflict

  - Arm-Az: ~13,000 games with 6,000 during conflict
  - Ukr-Ru: ~48,000 games with 18,000 during conflict
  
- Do people (chess players) reflect international conflict on their behavior?
  - How do they perform? I.e., accuracy
  - Do they play more "aggressively"?
  - Does the impact depend on who initiated the war/army size?

# Chess data: Board Complexity

- Estimate probability of making a mistake on a given position
  - Most positions are unique, so can't look at historical data
  - **Solution:** Machine learning, e.g., a neural network that learns the "types" of positions and where mistakes happen the most

```{r,echo=F, out.width="70%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("image3.png")
```
$\\[.1cm]$
- Trained on a separate sample with 25,000 games played in tournaments, ~2 million moves
- Use the model to estimate the complexity of games in the "conflict sample"

# Empirical Strategy in an Observational Setting

- Natural Experiments can "get close" to Randomized Control Trials (RCTs), if done properly.<br>
Example:
- An RCT proposal: Go over a list of applicants who applied to a college. Flip a coin for each applicant. If H, offer admission, otherwise deny admission.

# Empirical Strategy in an Observational Setting

- "Differences in Differences":
  - Ukrainian vs. Russian players before and after the war.
  - Their games against other non-conflict countries before and after war.
- "treated" games: UA-RU games after the war
- "control" games: UA-RU games before the war + UA-others and RU-others
- How do users get matched? Random. BUT, can someone "refuse" to play? Yes. (estimate the probability of "friendlyness" through friend lists.)


$Y_{ijg}=\gamma H_{ijg}+\pmb{X_{ijg}}'\pmb{\beta}+T_g+N_j+\alpha_i+u_{ijg}$

where $H_{ijg}$ equals 1 if a game $g$ between player $i$ and player $j$ happened between players of "treated" countries post the conflict starting date.

$Y_{ijg}$ include performance: average mistake, blunders; game outcomes e.g., win, loss; and the choice of game complexity.
  - Secondary outcomes: "How the game ended": e.g., "agree" to a draw, "stalling" a game; game length (measured by total number of moves).

# Conclusion

- Conflicts impact the quality of performance of chess players, but not much evidence for "more aggressive" games played.
  - Good news!
- Impact is not uniform: Ukrainian and Azeri players showed worse performance.
  - "Initiating side" theory? `r emo::ji("cross_mark")`
  - Public support of the conflict? Both Russia and Armenia received weaker support.
    - More public support -> worse concentration and/or (some) more aggressiveness -> worse performance
- Chess is just one platform to analyze. There could be more: video games, social media, ...
