Does Gen-AI make its users mentally passive over time?

--

Yes! Bastani, H., O. Bastani, A. Sungu, H. Ge, O. Kabakcƒ±, and R. Mariman (2024): "Generative AI can harm learning", *Working Paper*

--

Why and how is this happening?

--

**Critical thinking:** ability to evaluate and process information.

--

**Our research question:**

<blockquote>Do users exercise critical thinking when interacting with Gen-AI?</blockquote>

--

**It's not all negative:** Positive gains in worker settings. (Brynjolfsson et. al. 2023; Dell'Acqua et. al. 2023), ~30% speed and quality

--

**Takeaway:** Human capital should not be substituted with Gen-AI in high cognitive tasks.

# Our experiments

- Data collected through experiments on Cloudresearch platform.
--

  - 1,562 participants 
  - Ages 18 through 30 (age: future study!)
  - STEM student/graduate

--

**Experiment 1:** Critical thinking on AI output

**Experiment 2:** Remedy

**Experiment 3:** Consequences: Can people notice AI-written text?

# Appendix: Dictator Game

- What if the task is subjective? Are people's decisions still affected?

You are endowed with $2. A randomly selected participant in this study is designated as "recipient" and is endowed with $0. You have the option to give any portion of your endowment to the recipient. The recipient receives the amount that you decide to transfer to him/her; you keep the amount that you decide not to transfer. How much will you transfer?
